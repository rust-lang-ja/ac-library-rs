## Progress

Our first milestone is 2020/09/20, when the first ACL contest is planned.
We aim to implement the same toolset as original ACL(C++) on the day.

We are trying to implement with the same files by referring to the original ACL's hpp.
After that we try to improve our development flow, tests, or utilities.

## How to contribute

1. Create an issue or a draft PR before you start working.
2. Make a PR and pass tests.
