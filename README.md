ac-library-rs is a rust port of AtCoder Library (ACL).

See below for ACL.

- [AtCoder Library (ACL) - AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/posts/517)
- [AtCoder Library - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/82400)

## Progress

We are trying to keep up with the original ACL, to make APIs user-friendly, to fix known bugs, and so on.

- [Track the recent changes in atcoder/ac-library #91](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/ac-library-rs/issues/91)
- [Write rustdoc #75](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/ac-library-rs/issues/75)
- [Segtree: Monoid BitOrOper/BitAndOper/BitXorOper, FromIterator, get\_slice #115](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/ac-library-rs/pull/115)
- [u32 modulo fix #112](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/ac-library-rs/pull/112)

However, we can't afford to do all of these things by ourselves.
If you are using ac-library-rs, are familiar with competitive programming, and can find time, please help us.
